# CrudApi
    This project was generated with [DotNet CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/dotnet/core/tools/) version 6.0.113.

## Development server
    Run `dotnet run` for a dev server. Navigate to the generated `http://localhost:portnumber/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
    

## ConnectionString
    You need to change your ConnectionString based on your <strong>Server Name</strong>. In my case I used a Docker Container with SqlServer 2022 on it, and accessed on DBeaver to use it GUI.
    
## DotNet Packages
    The packages used in the project are located in "/CrudApi/CrudApi.csproj". If doesn't load, you just need to remove in the CrudApi.csproj and reinstall it by the DotNet CLI
